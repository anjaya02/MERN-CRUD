# CRUD APP

This is a full-stack CRUD application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The app allows users to upload, view, edit, and delete personal notes. It integrates RESTful APIs on the backend to handle the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of notes.

Features:
Create: Upload new notes with a simple interface.

Read: View a list of all uploaded notes.

Update: Edit existing notes.

Delete: Remove notes when no longer needed.

Responsive Design: Built with React.js for a smooth user experience across devices.

Backend: Node.js and Express.js are used to build the REST APIs for CRUD operations.

Database: MongoDB is used to store all note entries.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
REST API: Built with Express.js for handling requests.

This project demonstrates a basic CRUD functionality using the MERN stack and can be a foundation for more complex applications.
